    <h2>krill</h2>
    <h1>Fish Food. And penguin food. And whale food. And cute!</h1>
      <p> One could argue that krill are the basis of life in our oceans. Everyone eats them—penguins, whales, other fish, etc. They support the rest of the show. Krill’s environment is threatened by many things—acidification, microplastics, industry, development, and but most significantly by climate change.Krill live in the coldest parts of the ocean. Their habitat is changing at a rapid rate and they cannot adapt. So the krill, and everyone else who relies on them, are in serious danger.</p>

      <h3>It matters to you </h3>
      <h4> Krill are used in industrial farming as feed for other sea life. An extinction of krill would massively upset both the marine food web, and our own.</h4>
      <div class="accent">
        <h3>Do something different</h3>
        <p>Krill are also used in industrial farming and making omega-3 supplements. See what organizations you interact with that use krill are doing to protect them.
          <br>
          Do better by our oceans. Reduce or eliminate single-use plastic from your life and start taking steps towards reducing your personal carbon footprint.

    <h2>common loon</h2>
    <h1>Red-Eyed Lake Weirdo</h1>
      <p>When loons migrate to northern lakes in the spring and summer, they are increasingly met with less available food, smaller breeding grounds, and compromised ecosystems. One such compromise in the Great Lakes comes in the form of harmful algal blooms (HABs). Algal blooms happen when there is an excess of phosphorus in the water system for the algae to eat. It mostly comes from mistreated animal waste runoff from industrial agriculture (super gross). </p>

      <h3>It matters to you </h3>
      <h4> The loon’s conservation status helps us understand the health of its greater ecosystem. The Great Lakes are the largest source of freshwater in the world. If they can no longer safely support their native creatures, consider when they will no longer be safe for human use. </h4>
      <div class="accent">
        <h3>Do something different</h3>
        <p>Limit/Eliminate red meat consumption. Pay attention to where your food is coming from and who it affects downstream.

          Understand your local ecosystems and what actions you can take in your community.

      <h2>orangutan</h2>
      <h1>More than a Pretty Face</h1>
        <p>Most of the time, the motive for orangutan protection is the “big fluffy mammal argument” (they are large, they kind of look like us, sometimes they throw things which is pretty cute). However, having habitats that can support orangutan life is integral to a wider system. The South Asian rainforests in which they live are important parts of our great planetary climate, but they are being bulldozed down at an alarming rate for industrial agriculture—specifically the palm and soybean oil that we find in most of our processed foods and cosmetic products.  </p>

        <h3>It matters to you </h3>
        <h4> The loss of orangutans indicates how compromised the rainforests are. In addition to hosting significant portions of the planet’s biodiversity, Rainforests help regulate the planet’s climate, which is only becoming increasingly imperative. </h4>
        <div class="accent">
          <h3>Do something different</h3>
          <p>LLimit palm oil consumption or try to only purchase products that have the sustainably sourced palm oil seal. Check where products you use source palm oil and other cash crops. Use your purchasing power to support sustainable agriculture and development.

    <h2>honey bee</h2>
    <h1>Queen of the food chain</h1>
          <p>Like krill, bees support a wide food system that includes you and me. While bees don’t have many natural predators, the flora they pollinate feed lots of other animals in their ecosystems, including you (unless you’re not one for eating plants)! Bees really get a bad rap. Bees are extremely sensitive to our changing climate and their homes are being destroyed for land development. Their production is not being supported as it needs to be, and the craft of beekeeping is dwindling.</p>

          <h3>It matters to you </h3>
          <h4> 60% of crops, both commercially and personally grown, depend on bees for pollinations. Without bees, we can kiss many nuts, fruits, and flowers goodbye.</h4>
          <div class="accent">
            <h3>Do something different</h3>
            <p>Stop using products that hurt bees (pesticides)

<br>Start buying products that support bee production
<br>Maybe learn how to beekeep
