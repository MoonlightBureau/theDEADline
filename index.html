        <h2>Krill</h2>
        <h3>Fish food. And penguin food...</h3>
        <p>One could argue that krill are the basis of life in our oceans. Everyone eats them--penguins, whales, other fish, etc. They support the rest of the show. Krill’s environment is threatened by many things—acidification, microplastics, industry, development, and but most significantly by climate change.Krill live in the coldest parts of the ocean. Their habitat is changing at a rapid rate and they cannot adapt. So the krill, and everyone else who relies on them, are in serious danger.
